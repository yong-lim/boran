    ##### THE BUNONG BACKGROUND STORY

    Bunong people are the people originally living in Mundolkiri in community since
    the first times.

    They were hunter and lived in the forest. They lived with the nature and environment.

    The Bunong people started to use elephant like 120 years ago. Since then, 
    they always lived with the elephants. They need elephants for transport, agriculture,
    farming, hunting, building their houses, carrying the bamboo trees, going thru the
    river during wet season, visiting the family….

    They have always been living together; they have the same origins (“animism”) 
    and are living in Mundolkiri since the beginning.

    They must stay together because elephants have a spirit: they know who their 
    owner is, they have very good memory and are very gentle with the people taking
    care of them. One elephant lives with several families like 5 or 6. Usually the
    men ride them.

    The owner of the elephant is very strong: they know how to take care of the elephant 
    and make sacrifices for the spirits they believe in if the elephant gets sick.
    Elephant can live very long with the Bunong. They know natural medicine for them
    and they know how to help elephant live until 100 years old. Bunong people want
    elephants to stay with them, they don’t want to see them being sold to sanctuary
    or tourists places. They consider the elephants they live with like a real member
    of their family and can’t imagine living without them.

    ##### If something happens in the village, the elephant is the first to know.

    According to their traditional beliefs and rules, the elephant can get sick if 
    something wrong happens or if a member of their community breaks the rules: 
    like if a child is expected without the parents being married. In order to be 
    forgiven, they will make sacrifices for the elephant and the mahout which is
    the elephant’s rider.

    The mahout and the elephant are like a real couple: they remain bonded to each 
    other throughout their lives. The mahout must stay as pure as possible and scarifies
    his life to the elephant’s care : no marriage, no perfume, no modern things that 
    can harm the elephant’s future.

    Even the new generations want to see the elephant in freedom in their community; 
    the whole community doesn’t want the elephant to be controlled by any business
    or people. They consider the elephant like a grandfather or grandmother, being
    used to live with them ever since they were born..

    In fact, elephant eat for 23hours a day (200 kilos) so they go very far in jungle 
    and the Bunong people let them go and let them their freedom for them to be able
    to eat well what they need.

    The times they keep them in the village is when something important happens: dies, 
    wedding, new born : those celebrations are traditionally shared with the elephants
    who are a central member of the families;

    ##### WHAT THE ELEPHANT EAT EVERY DAY:
    Elephants eat Bamboo, grass, bananas, lianas, ….. some of the things they eat are
    natural medicines for them so they stay in health naturally as long as they keep
    their freedom.

    Every month, bunong make a scarify for the elephant in order to remember their 
    spirit and celebrate them. That’s traditional cultural for them. Celebration for
    elephants and for the forest to be forgiven if the elephant step or eat the forest
    spirits. And that s animism. They kill chicken or pig, and do painting on the elephant.
    The sacrifices will only be eaten by the mahout.

    ##### WHY WE WANT TO MAKE A COMMUNITY FOR THE BUNONG PEOPLE

    The sanctuary and other places wanting to rent the elephants from Bunong people 
    will make the loose of Bunong and elephant culture.

    We don’t want to lose that taking the elephant away from their natural environment 
    and by taking them away from the Bunong people who would also lose their traditional 
    culture and way of life.

    Our project is to support the Bunong people by allowing you to visit them and spend 
    time with the elephants in their real environment without removing them into sanctuaries 
    or other communities they’re not originally from.

    ##### RESPECT AND HELPFULL TOURIST AND ELEPHANT COMMUNITY

    Our concern is to respect the people and the animals by not changing their way of 
    life in order for them to keep their traditional beliefs and to be able to live even 
    though the protected forest today doesn’t allow them to hunt anymore and live from this 
    resource.

    Respecting all that, our program is made by and with the Bunong people. They offer to 
    show you a part of their usual day bringing you to their village where you will 
    participate to feed the elephant, wash them in the river and the waterfall and 
    the Bunong will tell you how to take care of them and how to live among them.

    Bunong people proposed to invite you to help them with the work they do every day 
    for living, like rice collecting, bamboo cutting in order to make baskets, elephants 
    healthiness….

    You can share a meal with them and they will show you how they cook and what they’re 
    concerned about.

    ##### Three elephants actually live with the Bunong people, here’s the story of one of them :

    G’vat is considered as the queen of the elephant. She’s 90 years old and she 
    survived from civil war, Khmer fights and has always lived with the Bunong community. 
    She is in great shape and we expect her to live for more decades in freedom. You could 
    meet her and enjoy a part of your day knowing her needs.

    Her story ; she now lives with six families taking very good care of her. She had a 
    long and hard life as she used to be controlled by the Khmer to work in rice fields. 
    Then, she was taken by the Polpot army to war. She used to carry the bullet war from 
    one place to another with other elephants that were killed by mines. When she remained 
    the only one alive, she ran away to the Lao border. Realizing they didn’t see her for 
    a long time, one of the Bunong man called G’rap called the spirit and made sacrifices 
    for her to come back.

    What a surprise for the Bunong village to hear something knocking hard on the ground 
    one month later ! G’vat was back home ! Since then, she is cherished and spend most 
    of her time hanging aroud searching for fresh food and rest in the forest.

    G’chring, Mekun  are the other elephants living with the families. They will be happy 
    to tell you about their stories too!

    ##### COMMUNITY FOREST PROTCETION AREA TREKKING

    Trekking can also be a good opportunity to get to know the jungle and the bunong community.

    We can organize a jungle trip bringing you on a trek with local guides that will tell 
    you all about what you would like to know such as medicinal plants, trees, wild animals, 
    fishing and living in the protected areas around here.

    You can experience living with them for a couple of days if you wish. We will contact 
    them and arrange you a unique experience with the bunong.

    If you are interested in supporting the bunong people and learn about their culture 
    we will be pleased to show you the way. In fact, most of their land has been sold 
    to big companies and the deforestation doesn’t allow them to live from the work 
    they used to have before.

    Tourism is growing here since a couple of years and the bunong community wish to be 
    part of it in a way they can share their culture with foreigners and learn from them 
    as well as an exchange. This could allow them to keep their culture like they have 
    always had without being forced to leave the forest for jobs in the cities.

    They’re counting on you to help them keep their community alive and preserve the 
    elephants from being sold to sanctuary where they would just be shown off and ride 
    by the tourist as an attraction.

    This program we are trying to settle up will help them stay in their village as 
    you will be able to see when taking part of it.

    It is really important that tourism benefits can go to help this community living 
    on this land forever. Please let us know if you want to take a part of it!
